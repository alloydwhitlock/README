“The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.”  - Bertrand Russell

## Introduction

My name is Adam Whitlock (pronouns he/him) and I am an engineering leader. I have three children, all avid readers and almost always running off with their friends on adventures. I love to bike and go on walks, which means I live next to a well-loved trail. I listen to a lot of music and appreciate a good cup of coffee, which means I'll post some info about both of those hobbies below. 

I come from a background in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Data Platform teams. I care about ensuring that teams follow good SRE practices, are focused on delivering good results, always curious about problems, and understand that they own the problems that their teams can solve. Additionally, I have led a number of infrastructure and securirty teams, meaning I care a lot about the good fundamental operation and management of systems. Building stable, reliable, and secure platforms are my happy place. 


## Meetings

### 1:1's
I will have at least one dedicated 30 minute meeting with engineers that report to me once a week; a 1:1. Meetings may need to be moved during the week, but the idea is to have some dedicated time to talk where ideas or concerns can be discussed. The 1:1 can be used as a status update, though I prefer to talk about things that are on top-of-mind, such as solving problems or personal life. 

### General Office Hours
My "office hours" are the times that I'm guaranteed to be at my desk, available for meetings. It doesn't mean that I'll see an email or a Slack message, but it increases the chances that I will. While you can reach out after those hours, please do not expect replies until the following day (barring emergencies).

**Monday through Friday**

_09:30 CST - 17:30 CST_

_15:30 UTC - 23:30 UTC_

_00:30 JST - 08:30 JST_

### General Availability
I try to be as open with my schedule as possible, leaving flexible time to have impromptu conversations in Slack or Zoom. Without a hallway or break room to hang out in at times, that natural "gap" in the day needs to happen somewhere. You do not need to ask me if you can schedule a meeting directly; simply schedule it and I'll accept if I can attend. 

### Focus Time (Deep Work) 
My calendar will have blocks of time booked each week for "focus time". This is the time that I use to focus on accomplishing a work task, such as writing this README.md or learning a skill like writing Clojure. I'm a firm believer in using focus time to accomplish work, even if it's not 100% focused on deep work. 

If you are not familiar with using focus time (or deep work), there is a great introduction blog post by Doist that provides  an overview: [https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/)

## Guiding Principles

### Patience, Especially With People
Not everyone is you and not everyone may be having a good day/month/year/decade. 

### Giving Feedback 
Feedback requires consent. Make sure people are open to receiving it before giving it, even if it's a meeting like "annual review". See the line about patience. 

### Make It Work, Then Make It Work Better
You may have also heard this as "perfect is the enemy of good", but what it comes down to is "make something happen". Focusing on making the perfect product the first time is a perfectionists trap. Work on scoping the work down to the bare requirements, set a schedule, then work on it until it's done. Once your "it" is done, then worry about the features you wanted. 

### Mistakes Happen
We all make mistakes. What's important is that we learn from our mistakes. Blameless post-incident processes and leaving comments in code about attempted changes are great ways to learn and ensure we don't make the same mistake twice. 

### Small Changes Over Time
Making smaller changes over time will eventually impact the larger work. This can be small, frequent deploys to a production service. It can also be minor changes to a habit over time, eventually realizing you've remembered to take a daily vitamin for a month. Whatever it is you want to do, make sure you work your way to it. 

### Missing Details
I need feedback to be better, so if I'm not defining something well or giving direction please let me know. I can sometimes become excited in the fact we're getting something done and forget to lay that groundwork that can make whatever we're doing more successful. 

### Work/Life Balance Exists
We've all got personal lives, myself included. Do your best to set working hours and stick to them, that way people understand when you are working. I list mine as part of my "office hours". I hold myself accountable to being available in those hours and set clear expectations I won't be reachable for work otherwise. I can work in those outside hours, but that's my decision as much as working an odd hour here or there can be your own.


## Extra Information

### Work Books
These are some books I've found interesting or I've suggested to others. I've started a non-comprehensive list here and maybe someday it'll grow. It's a worthwhile experiment. 
- "The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains" Nicholas Carr
- "The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right" Atul Gawande 
- "Site Reliability Engineering"  Beyer, Jones, Petoff and Murphy 
- "How Music Works" David Byrne
- "An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management" Will Larson

### Music
Honestly, I've been listening to too much dreampop & shoegaze lately. I'm going to own that. If you like vinyl records, I've started to put my collection into Discogs. You can view it here: [https://www.discogs.com/user/alloydwhitlock/collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/alloydwhitlock/collection)
