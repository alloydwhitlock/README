# Adam Whitlock's Gift List

## Background ##
Every year I get asked "hey, what do you want for X holiday". I usually say "something useful" and get wool socks. I have a lot of wool socks. I have so many wool socks now that I think I can go a winter without wearing the same pair twice. Though that's another story. This is about why I have a gift list online. 

This is to prevent the backlog of wool socks from growing. I have this list, where I can add or make suggestions. If someone is technical or motivated enough, they can even file a PR to make a change! 

## Gift Cards ##
The following stores are some places where I can buy vinyl records or components.

### Vinyl Records ###
I love records and my collection can grow. 
* [Strictly Discs](https://strictlydiscs.com/giftcards)
* [Retrospekt](https://retrospekt.com/products/digital-gift-card-for-analog-stuff)
* [Turntable Lab](https://www.turntablelab.com/products/turntablelab-gift-card)

### Coffee ###
Do not buy me coffee. If you care about me, just give me a card to one of these places. Why? Well, I can order the coffee when I need it and it can be fresh. When I get too much cofffee, usually around holidays or my birthday, I end up with too much and it starts getting stale. Just get the card. Trust me, I'll appreciate it. 

* [Ruby Coffee Roasters](https://rubycoffeeroasters.com/products/gift-card)
* [Brandywine Coffee Roasters](https://www.brandywinecoffeeroasters.com/collections/accessories/products/gift-card)

### Donation ###
I'll never be mad if you donate to a good cause instead of giving me a gift. In fact, I'd love it! Here's a few causes I can think of (please, make suggestions for more):
* [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/support)
* [Wisconsin Public Radio](https://wpr.org/donate)
* [Doctors Without Borders](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/secure/donate)
